Cloud Trace Service Trigger CTS
===============================

You can write a FunctionGraph function. According to the CTS cloud audit
service type and the event notification required for the operation subscription,
when the CTS cloud audit service obtains the subscribed operation record, the
collected operation record is passed as a parameter (CTS sample event) through
the CTS trigger to call the FunctionGraph function. Through the function, the
key information in the log is analyzed and processed, and the system, network
and other business modules are automatically repaired, or alarms are generated
through SMS, email, etc. to notify business personnel to handle. For the use of
CTS triggers, please refer to `Using a CTS Trigger <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/function-graph/umn/creating_triggers/using_a_cts_trigger.html>`__.
